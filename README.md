Level 1: We have both pairs of computers in the same subnet. So according to the mask (255.255.255.0) we can choose any address between 104.95.23.1 - 104.95.23.254 (excluding 0 and 255 on edges). And 104.95.23.12 as taken.
Repeat the same logic for the second pair. With the mask (255.255.0.0) and higher available range we can put any address between 211.191.0.1 - 211.191.255.254
